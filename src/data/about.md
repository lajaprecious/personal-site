# Intro

I am a co-founder and the CTO of [Eyita](https://eyita.com) that started as an agricultural company in Nigeria that purchased and shipped farm products from rural areas to metropolitan centers. In 2020, it developed into a logistic company that transported goods both domestically and abroad. With contemporary solutions like web applications and data analysis, Eyita also offers consulting services to enterprises and start-ups, giving its clients an online presence. I am particularly interested in projects that touch health and safety, imaging, social impact, and data analysis. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At Eyita, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I primarily work as a data engineer, but I have extensive knowledge in a variety of fields..

# Some history

- I'm the oldest of five kids—myself, a sister and three brothers. Like the majority of parents in Nigeria, my parents instilled in me the importance of leading by example for my siblings.

- At age nine, I started high school. In my senior year of high school I served as the boy Health Prefect.

- At the age of 15, I was admitted to the Pure and Applied Mathematics Department of [Ladoke Akintola University of Technology](https://www.lautech.edu.ng), where graduated with first-class honors. 

- I started playing chess that year and have continued to do so ever since. 

- While taking a MATLAB class in my second year of college, I fell in love with simulation and data visualization, which marked the beginning of my career as a data analyst.

- I spent this period learning new skills like home wiring and fashion styling while my school was involved in numerous strike activities.

- I took an embedded systems class in my final year as an undergraduate where I learnt about circuits, microcontrollers, raspberry pie, and so much more.

- I co-founded the wine merchant and agricultural business Eyita with my immediate family when I was 22 years old. The name Eyita was created by coiling my mother's Yoruba first name, "Eyitayo," which means "It ought to be celebrated."

- Even though I like to learn new things, I prefer to play chess, watch movies, listen to music, or interact with others when I have free time. My current ELO rating in chess is 1700+. I enjoy watching a wide variety of movies, with sitcoms being my favorite, and listening to good music from all genres, with R&B being my favorite. I enjoy engaging in scholarly discourse on subjects like existentialism, physics, religion, and philosophy.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
